# Hypixel Stats - Apple Watch App

This is a small app  for the Apple Watch that I made to display the [Hypixel Network](https://hypixel.net) player count on a complication. Just a fair warning that _I have no idea what I'm doing_ and I just kinda rushed this in a few hours from examples on Google (pro developer I know)

## Installing the app

To install this you'll need Xcode on macOS and at least watchOS 4 (may work with 3 but not tested). Anyone can install this for free for 7 days at a time as long as you have an Apple account. You'll also need to replace "_REPLACE_WITH_KEY_" with your Hypixel API key for the app to work.

## Support

If you need any help feel free to open an issue or shoot be a tweet [@ConnorLinfoot](https://twitter.com/ConnorLinfoot). But no promises that I'll be able to help you with any issues.

## Contributing

Want to help out and improve the app? Go ahead, feel free to make a pull request with any improvements you make! :)

## Future plans

I do hope to work on this app more, including an easier way to setup the app with the API key and possibly other options. I would also like to make it release-ready and get it on the App Store, not sure how likely that is to happen however.
